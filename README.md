# PCA_NMF
Performs PCA and NMF of EMG signals in a time series with plots
This is an ongoing project and is means to take the time series of EMG data and perform a PCA and NMF for each subject.
For example, all subjects may be put into a no.frames x no. muscles x subjects matrix. This assumes they have been time normalized, band pass filtered, and a linear envelope performed. An example preprocess is included.
